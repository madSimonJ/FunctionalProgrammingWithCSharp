#  The Martian Trail # 

This is the current version of the source code for the computer game "The Martian Trail".  Written by me - Simon J. Painter - as part of the work for my book "Functional Programming with C#", published by O'Reilly Media.

The game wasn't finished in time for publication of the book, so this represents the most up-to-date version of the source.

This game is an attempt to put together a lot of the functional concepts learned over the course of my book in what is hopefully an entertaining example, and something that - once finished - you'll be able to play for yourself.

Please feel free to contribute your own improvements. I'll ensure you're properly credited if you do.
